# Issue Management

For issue management we highly recommend to use an issue tracking tool. One possible, right now quite popular solution, would be JIRA from Atlassian.

Your issue management tool should reflect the way your team works in terms of artefacts \(e.g. epics, stories, bugs, etc\) and workflows \(e.g. status open -&gt; in progress -&gt; in review -&gt; closed\). The closer this is to your way of working the more natural it feels to use the tool.

Since bugs can, due to their nature, not be estimated, it is deemed a good practice to use the average effort for already solved bugs as a estimation. This might not be accurate for each bug but should level over time.

Therefor it is usefull if the tool of your choice provides you with an interface or plugins to create statistics to help in an empiric way. To get a better feeling for the effort you put in solving bugs or implementing stories, it might be useful to track the time you spent on each issue \(this should only be used for team internal reasons, not to control, etc.\).

It is recommended to not assign tasks that were not started yet. In addition tasks that are not created by the team but by an external source should be assigned to the person responsible for prioritization. This person should make sure that the basic information needed to start that task is within the ticket.

In general it is recommended to provide at least the following information:

* ID
* Name 
* Description \(what to do, preconditions, acceptance criteria etc.\)
* Assignee
* Reporter
* Status

In case the issue is a bug, it should include the following information, too:

* Affected Version \(of the software in which the bug occured\)
* Fix Version \(makes life easier for testers\)
* Steps to reproduce \(in description, including detailed data needed\)
* Screenshots if possible

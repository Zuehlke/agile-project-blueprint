# Stakeholders

In the context of a software project a stakeholder is a person or group that is somehow involved in the project either by influencing the the project result or being influenced by the result. Neglecting the stakeholders can put a project at risk, e.g. a sponsor could refuse to fund the project or users could refuse to work with the delivered software. Therefore it is essential to know all the stakeholders and to have a plan how to handle each of them.

## Identify the Stakeholders

First create a list of all stakeholders.

List of possible stakeholders:

* Project Manager
* Testers
* User Representatives
* Security Officers
* Finance
* Architects
* Business Analysts
* Other development teams \(your teams depends on\)

When you have created the list identify the type of involvement for every stakeholder: Does he just need to be informed? Can he influence the project e.g. by changing the project scope?

## Prioritize the Stakeholders

Stakeholder management usually can be a very time expensive task. For some stakeholders it is completely sufficient to keep them informed about the project's progress, others require intensive care. The Stakeholder Map can help prioritizing the stakeholders.

## Handle the Stakeholders

When you have a prioritized list of your stakeholders define how to handle them.

* Define which person or group is responsible for handling this stakeholder
* Define how often the stakeholder needs to be involved \(daily meeting? monthly report? ...\)
* Decide on how the communication works \(personal meeting, e-mail, phone calls, other tools, ...\)
* Conduct a meeting where the team and the stakeholders meet and find a consens about communication and : Team + all stakeholders to get to know each other and find a common understanding about the official communication channels
  * e.g. if a business analyst has a change on a requirement he talks to the product owner, not directly to the developer
  * e.g. if a developer wants to know about the overall progress of the project he can ask the project manager

## Re-identify and re-analyze Stakeholders

Stakeholders may change during a project or their importance may vary depending on the project state. Therefore it is very important that the stakeholders are re-prioritized on a regular basis \(e.g. every month\).

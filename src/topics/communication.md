# Communication

One of the principles behind the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html "Agile Manifesto") says:

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

It is recommended that the communication is following a simple pattern. If possible, communicate face to face. If not try to have at least some voice communication. If that is not possible either, prefere synchronous written communication over asynchronous written communication. This does explicitly not mean you should not document anything because you talked about it.

There are a bunch of possibilities to foster good communication within the team. Working co-located, having a daily sync meetings and the right tools to commmunicate helps. In the end, communication, like the team itself, should evolve during the project.

Communication not only happens within the team, it also involves the stakeholders. The methods here may differ due to technical restrictions and their different environments. Basically the same principals apply. The ways of communication should be defined at the kickoff. The stakeholder should be involved at a regular basis \(reviews, etc.\) to ensure fast feedback.

The following toolchain is deemed useful based on recent experience:

Voice Communication:

* Skype / Skype for business / Lync, etc. \(Video and Audio Calls/Conference Calls\)

Synchronous written communication:

* Slack \(Chatrooms, Topics, Direct Messaging, Group Chats\)

Asynchronous written communication:

* E-Mail
* Issue Tracker \(Issue Discussions\)

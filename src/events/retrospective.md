# Retrospective

One of the principles behind the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html "Agile Manifesto") says:

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

This can be done by conducting "retrospective" meetings. During this meeting the team reflects what went well or what didn't go well and what the team wants to change for the next iteration.

## Who should participate?

The retrospective meeting is team-driven, therefore all members of the team should be present and participate actively.

The team members should feel comfortable to utter their concerns and express their thoughts. This is why persons not part of the team \(e.g. a project manager, a client, a superior ...\) must not participate in that meeting as the presence of such people could prevent an open and honest atmosphere.

## When should a Retrospective be held?

Ideally a rtrospective is held at the end of every iteration. Calling off a retrospective usually is a bad idea as problems and impediments could remain undiscovered for another iteration which can negatively influence the performance of the team and some team members may start feeling discontent when they cannot speak out what is bothering them.

Customer projects are often under time and cost pressure. As a result Retrospective meetings tend to be neglected as the customer or other stakeholders often do not see a direct advantage conducting a Retrospective. Teams should insist on the Retrospective meeting. They should talk to the stakeholders about the importance of such a meeting and that the team should be given the time and space to conducting it.

## How long does a Retrospective usually take?

The retrospective meeting should be a strictly timeboxed event. Of course you can finish the meeting when you have the feeling that you are through and no more insights will be generated if the meeting lasts longer but you should never exceed the timebox.

In Scrum a retrospective meeting takes 3 hours for a four week iteration for shorter iterations it's usually shorter.

## Before the Meeting

### Explain the Goal of the Meeting

Every participant should understand the importance of the Retrospective. Explain the goal of the meeting to the team - improving the process by inspecting the past iteration\(s\) and define actions to trigger this improvement.

### Warm up the Team

Especially in teams where the people don't know each other well yet, chances are high that there are timid persons that don't like to expose themselves or are not used to express their thoughts to other people. Try to break the ice by conducting some warm-up exercises. Following are two ideas for warm-up exercises but when you search the internet you will find hundreds more.

#### Job Title Game

1. Each person thinks back about the last sprint or iteration and what they did. Then based on that writes a job title that would match what they did. Try to be funny or silly and stay away from something that HR would come up with \(e.g. “SW Engineer”, “Test automation expert”\).
2. Collect each participant’s job title in a container and mix them up.
3. Pull out one piece of paper and read it aloud. The team tries to guess, who came up with the title \(for themselves\) and why. If they’re right, move on to the next piece of paper.

#### The Journey

Let each person describe the last iteration as their personal journey from one location to another:

1. Define a point of departure and a destination \(e.g. "from Rome to Paris"\) or let the persons define their own destination.
2. Let the people describe their journey: How did they travel \(by foot, by car, by plane, a mix of everything, ...\)? Did they have to overcome certain obstacles \(e.g. cross a swamp, climb a mountain\)? Was the direction straight or did they take a detour or a shortcut? Did they meet interesting persons? Did they discover something special during the journey?
3. Let the team guess which journey event matches to which event during the last iteration, e.g. "crossing the swamp" could associate with "Story 123 was hard to implement as we had to deal with a lot of untested legacy code".

## During the Meeting

It's a good practice to split the retrospective meeting into the following five steps:

1. **Set the stage: **The introduction for the retro, make the idea and the goal of this meeting clear to the team, answer open questions
2. **Gather data:** Look back at the last iteration and collect as much information as possible
3. **Generate insights: **Analyze and discuss the data gathered in the last step, look for causes, patterns and connections
4. **Decide what to do: **define SMART actions
5. **Close the retrospective: **Gather feedback from the team about the retro

### Ideas for the Retrospective

#### Four Squares Retrospective

The four squares retrospective is probably the most simple form of a retrospective. It is a good starting point especially for teams that have never attended a retrospective meeting before.

Draw four squares as follows on a flipchart or whiteboard. Then let the participants write items on post-its and stick them in the appropriate square. Define a timebox for collecting post-its.

![](/assets/four_squares_retro.png)

* **Things that went well: **Things you want to keep as is or do even more of it because they went well
* **Things that did not go well:** Things you want to do less, do differently or even stop doing
* **Bright ideas:** New ideas that could bring an improvement for the next iterations
* **Appreciations: **Compliment on someone who did a good job or just say "thank you"

When you're done with collecting post-it items you go through all the items, analyze and discuss it. Maybe it makes sense to cluster some items if they deal with the same issues. Again define a timebox for this step.

Then define SMART actions from the items. Usually most actions will evolve from the "bright ideas" and the "things that did not go well" section. And again define a timebox for this step. Sometimes it is better to have only a few actions that can be done during the next iteration instead of having tons of actions where half of it will probably not be done until the next retrospective meeting.

#### Different Retrospectives

When the team feels comfortable with the retrospective you can start changing the format of the meeting. You can get tons of ideas for alternative retrospective formats online. A good source is the "[Retromat](https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/ "Retromat")".

## Closing the Meeting

Conduct a short retrospective retrospective to find out how the retrospective format worked out for the participants and what can be improved for the next meeting.

## Tips and Tricks, Dos and don'ts

### Change is good

If a Retrospective is always held in the same way at the same place it will generate a very similar output, people will get bored and certain problems within the team will remain undiscovered.

#### Re-locate

Try to change the location where the meeting is held, this prevents participants from feeling too comfortable in their accustomed place.

#### Swap the Facilitator

Swap the facilitator role within the team or use an external facilitator. This will automatically change the way the meeting is held and new ideas, issues or similar may pop up.

#### Change the Meeting Format

There is nothing that is more boring than answering the same questions every two weeks. The same questions often produce the same answers. Try to change the format and also try to change the focus of the meeting. Sometimes you may want to find out how the team feels, sometimes you want to focus on technical issues, collaboration, quality or all together. Below you will find a couple of ideas how to conduct a retrospective \(see "During the meeting"\).

#### Change the Way of gathering Data

Some people can speak openly in front of a large group whereas some are very timid. Collect data by word of mouth with the whole team, split into small groups or let the team write their thoughts down on paper - also think about doing it anonymously as some feel uncomfortable being exposed too much.

### Define SMART Actions

The goal of a retrospective is to define actions to improve the process. However, to define good and reasonable actions is not as easy as some people may think. A good method to define actions is to apply the SMART criterias:

| Letter | Meaning | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S | Specific | The action describes the desired result. Avoid expressions like "more" or "better", e.g. instead of "we should write more tests" say "by the end of the next iteration we want to improve our test coverage by 5%". Also avoid words like "try" or "should". |
| M | Measurable | In order to be able to decide if an action is complete its outcome must be measurable so the question "is it complete?" can be answered with a clear "yes" or "no". |
| A | Attainable | Don't define actions that are not realistic, e.g. actions that depend on other persons on which you do not have any influence. The |
| R | Relevant | Where appropriate, link the goal to a higher-level departmental or organizational goal, and ensure that the employee understands how their goal and actions contributes to the attainment of the higher level goal. This gives the employee a context for their work. |
| T | Time-based | Specify when the goal needs to be completed, e.g. "within two weeks" |

In addition to these five SMART criterias I also recommend to assign an action item to a person. This person is not necessarily the one who executes the action but is responsible for it being executed. If an action is clearly defined using the SMART criterias but nobody feels responsible for it chances are very high that this action remains open until the next retrospective.

### Plan your Retrospective

If you want to get the most out of your retrospective meeting it is mandatory that you plan the meeting. Define timeboxes and enforce them. It would be quite frustrating for all participants if you gather tons of data but you don't have the time to define actions.

### Visualize Actions

Place the retrospective actions where everybody can see them. Of course you can send the action items by e-mail to all team members but it is very likely that sometimes an action vanishes in a flood of e-mails and at the next retrospective meeting you realize that the action is still an open issue. You could write the actions on post-its and stick them to your agile board where everybody can see them.

# Story Kickoff

A story kickoff is a technique that brings together all people involved in a story \(e.g. architect, product owner, designer, developers, tester, etc.\) before someone starts to work on it. Who is involved in completing the story strongly depends on your teams setup and process.

The goal of this meeting, is to sharpen the common understanding of the story and to identify dependencies between the people involved. In case you have specific roles in your setup that depend on each others work, it might be a good possibility to establish a common  timeline.

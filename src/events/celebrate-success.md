# Celebrate Success

If the project finishes a phase successfully \(e.g. first successful production release\) this should be celebrated. This is important because:

* **Motivation**  
  Celebrating success is a kind of appreciation to the people who did a good job in the past days. Appreciation is an important booster for motivation which could lead to even better performance in the following iterations.

* **Make success visible to others**  
  The idea of making success visible is not to show off but to raise awareness about the things that go well. A sponsor might be willing to invest more in the project if he sees that his investments pay off.

* **Learn and adapt**  
  To celebrate success helps to recognize what's working well. So basically you can do more of it.

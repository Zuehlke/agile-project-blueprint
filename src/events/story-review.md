# Story Review

A story review is a short meeting in which the people responsible for the completion of the story and the product owner or who ever is in charge for the requirements sit together and review the created functionality. 

The goal of the meeting is to check if the story fulfills the definition of done and if the functionality created matches the expectations of the PO. It is recommended to have this meeting as the last step of completing a story.

In addition to this small, informal meeting, it is deemed a good practice to review each story together with the team and all interested stakeholders to make sure, everyone has a good picture of the current state of the project and the possibility to give feedback.To keep that bigger review efficient, it make sense to have it for several stories at once \(e.g. at the end of each iteration\) and not for every single story.
